Modify the code from Example 8.9 to find the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for this potential when $m$ is the electron mass, $V_0 = 50$ eV, and $a = 10^{-11}$ m. Note that in theory the wavefunction goes all the way out to $x = \\pm \\infty$, but you can get good answers by using a large but finite interval. Try using $x = - 10a$ to $+10a$, with the wavefunction $\\psi = 0$ at both boundaries. (In effect, you are putting the harmonic oscillator in a box with impenetrable walls.) The wavefunction is real everywhere, so you don't need to use complex variables, and you can use evenly spaced points for the solution-- there is no need to use an adaptive method for this problem.\n",

To normalize the wavefunctions you will have to calculate the value of the integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} |\\psi(x)|^2 {\\rm d}x$ and then rescale $\\psi$ appropriately to ensure that the area under the square of each of the wavefunctions is 1. Either the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule will give you a reasonable value for the integral. *(15 pts.)*\n",

One simple way to deal with the large values is to make use of the fact that the system is symmetric about its midpoint and calculate the integral of the wavefunction over only the left-hand half of the system, then double the result. This neatly misses out the large values. \n",
